# hello-world
This repository is intended to familiarize myself with the use of GitHub.

There was a request to finish the README file, and i want to do so, even if there is no further functionality planned in this project.

Further edits to the README file were added in a special branch for this purpose. Even for a single user, branching seems a reasonable practice to retain the working master code at specific versions.
